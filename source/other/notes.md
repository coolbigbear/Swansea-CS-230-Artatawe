#Notes

Here we'll put notes and ideas and shit

* The tests will basically be the summing up of the requirements

* We need to try and do the Custom Drawing shit soon 

* We need to have a general idea on Feed, make sure to separate the idea of a Feed from being the view stuff, a Feed could be a Collection of Auctions and this Feed could automatically update depending on the user's choice of what they want to see, this Collection will be read from the Database, Bezhan we need to look into this.

* Question about JSON, should we write in each class of the objects that we will store a toJSON() method? I don't know how JSON works entirely.
