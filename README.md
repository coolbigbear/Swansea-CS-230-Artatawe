# Artatawe auctioning system 
This system works in the same way as ebay but with a twist. The auctions have a set amount of bids, when those run out the last bid is the winnder of that auction.

This project was created for the module CS-230 at Swansea University. This is a group project which I was a part of.

# Usage
- Run `Artatawe_v2.jar` **OR** run `source/controllers/Main.java`
